This picture is a World War II hanger with doors on each end that allow planes to drive through the facility. This hanger was used for plane repairs and is now used for storage concerning parts of planes. This image shows that the facilities are still well preserved. A facility that only had private access is now available to the public. We hope this gives viewers insight of the facility before restoring it into a museum.
