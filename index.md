This picture is a World War II hanger with doors on each end that allow planes to drive through the facility. This hanger was used for plane repairs and is now used for storage concerning parts of planes. This image shows that the facilities are still well preserved. A facility that only had private access is now available to the public. We hope this gives viewers insight of the facility before restoring it into a museum.

This image encompasses the watch tower and the splash gaurds that were used during the Cold War. This photo shows the importance of the procedures that took place at the base. This cannot be seen by the public. However, it is now being brought to you through pictures and will be shown in the museum once it is restored.
